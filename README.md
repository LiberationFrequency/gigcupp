What is it?  
-----------------------------------
Gig Collection Universal Plug'n'Play is a collection of presets and other accessories create on my own for music applications and dedicated equipment. Especially designed for the integration into BazzArch, but it should works everywhere, if the apps, plugins and/or equipment are available.
